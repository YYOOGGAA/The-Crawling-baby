Itâ€™s a 2D game requiring two players. The game screen is composed of a moving stairs, two little babies and some randomly appeared tools. The goal of each player is to run faster than the moving stairs. Players can pick up the tools to lower down another player or to speed up themselves. The one who firstly disappears from the screen is lost.
